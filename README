These scripts are like git new-workdir, and can be used to create and update
rsync mirror directories of several branches from one .git.

The scripts generate a .patch file.

They were originally written for perl.git and the rsync mirror, but were
forgotten and eventually not used.

I have posted them in case they are useful for anyone else.
